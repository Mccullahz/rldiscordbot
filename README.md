# Rocket League Discord Bot
- The purpose of this project is quite simple, but should do a good job at testing the waters on something that I've wanted to do for some time now:
Creating discord bots...

### Features
The key features of this bot are to integrate automatic parsing of the official Rocket League sites to check for updates on a few different things... We wamt to check:

    - 1. RLCS updates, IE who plays who, when, and where to watch it. Potentially finding scores of games?
    -2. RL patch notes, what the patches include and potentially a deep dive into the notes...
    -3. Potentially adding a daily or weekly update on an individuals MMR based off of rltracker data.
